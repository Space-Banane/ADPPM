# 🎨 Active Directory Profile Picture Management

**ADPPM** is a lightweight Go-based tool designed for SysAdmins to efficiently manage and update profile pictures in Active Directory.

## 💡 Why?

I couldn't find a proper tool that works from anywhere with a simple, lightweight UI—so I built one myself.

## ✨ Features

- 👥 View and manage user profiles
- 📸 Upload new profile pictures
- ⭕ Auto-round profile pictures for a polished look

### 🎁 Bonus

Configure `config.json` to enable authentication and remote access (hosts the web interface on all network interfaces)
